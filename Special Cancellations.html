            <h2>What are Special Cancellations?</h2>
            <p>Special cancellations are unique postmarks that are applied to mail to commemorate a specific event, place, or theme. They are highly sought after by collectors for their rarity, historical significance, and aesthetic appeal. These cancellations often feature unique designs and are only available for a limited time, making them valuable additions to any philatelic collection.</p>
